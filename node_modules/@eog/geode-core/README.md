# `@eog/geode-core`

Welcome to the Geode Core Library!

:rotating_light: This library is in the experimental stage and will go through many iterations as we develop this in conjunction with the design team. Expect frequent breaking changes!

## To install

In your client application:

`yarn add @eog/geode-core` or `npm install @eog/geode-core`

## Getting Started

To make these components work currently, you will also need to install and import `@eog/geode-colors` so that you can import default themes into your application. If you get TypeErrors from a geode component like `TypeError: Cannot read property 'propertyName' of undefined`, it's most likely because the component requires a particular theme property in it's styling. Make sure you are using the most up-to-date version of `eog/geode-colors` package.

In your `theme/index.tsx` file, or wherever you are creating your `ThemeProvider`, do the following:

```tsx
//import the palettes
import {
  geodeColors,
  darkPalette,
  lightPalette,
  overrides,
  typography,
  shadows,
} from '@eog/geode-colors';

//put the palettes in your theme function that returns a MUI theme with our
//colors and properties
const theme = React.useMemo(
  () =>
    makeBaseTheme({
      palette: prefersDarkMode ? darkPalette : lightPalette,
      geode: geodeColors,
      overrides,
      typography,
      shadows,
    }),
  [prefersDarkMode, currentWidth],
);

//Then put the theme in your ThemeProvider like normal
return (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <CssBaseline />
    {children}
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Then, you can start importing the components like so:

```tsx
import { GeodeRail, GeodeAppBar } from '@eog/geode-core';
```

And things should just look the way they are supposed to! All of the components are exported from the same root file.
